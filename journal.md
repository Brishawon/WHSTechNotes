In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
probably not that mutch.
What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
your grade will decrease.
Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?
because you have too do all of the work and if you dont you grade will go down.
Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.
