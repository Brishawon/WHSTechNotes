In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
probably not that mutch.
What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
your grade will decrease.
Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?
because you have too do all of the work and if you dont you grade will go down.
Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online? 
if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms.

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?
Authentication to GitHub.
Create a strong password.
Switching between accounts.
Verifying devices on sign in.

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?
none of the stuff that i share on the internet is not that personal.

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?
limit data access and sharing to only those who need it and only for the purposes that are relevant and necessary for your collaboration

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.
Ways to protect personal data include using privacy settings, reviewing tagged posts, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and being cautious with email attachments and links. There are numerous safeguards in place, including the use of technology to protect data for example by restricting access (using passwords or swipe cards to control access to data), or using encryption so the data can only be read with a code. IT systems must be kept up-to-date to protect against viruses and hacking.

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:

What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year? a condition of mental fogginess, lethargy, reduced attention span, and cognitive decline that results from an overabundance of screen time. 
How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024? The way how people from a game have it on story in other universe
In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how? brain rot is a word that probably some thing that people could call stupid but is mostly mean for people watch some weird videos.
Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year here.
