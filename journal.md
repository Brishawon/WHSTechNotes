You can create custom images using Sphero Edu's built in Matrix Animation editor.BOLT's magnetometer is designed to measure
Earth's magnetic field and help you find magnetic north, which means, you can use
BOLT as a compass.You can use those lux values to create dynamic programs that respond differently to different types of light and light intensities.

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
probably not that mutch.
What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
your grade will decrease.
Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?
because you have too do all of the work and if you dont you grade will go down.
Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

Last week we looked at computer science jobs. This week we'll look at applying computer science to jobs in any industry. I'd like you to consider why is learning to code valuable regardless of the industry you choose to work in?

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

# October 15, 2024
How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
so you can learn how to make game
How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
probably if you can understand you can do more
How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?
if you are popular or have a community
Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.

The Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.

Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
How Does AI Promote Innovation? AI transforms business operations and processes by automating routine tasks, extracting insights from data sets, and enhancing customer experiences. 
Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?
Machine Learning bias, also known as algorithm bias or Artificial Intelligence bias, refers to the tendency of algorithms to reflect human biases.
Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.
On the risk side, when one drives or gets on the road in general, there is a risk of getting caught in a traffic accident and getting badly injured. Potential risk refers to any risk associated with an action that is possible, in certain circumstances. A risk refers to a threat or damage that may occur in operations of any work.

With the upcoming election, technology plays a huge role in various aspects, from voting machines to social media. 
How do you think computer science and technology impact the election process? 
the impact of the computer science and tech is how will you make games or how much longer you are going to make a game or you want to play or create game that no one might not play.
Discuss one positive impact and one potential challenge or concern. Be sure to provide specific examples of how programming, security, or technology influences elections today.

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online? 
if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms.

What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?
Authentication to GitHub.
Create a strong password.
Switching between accounts.
Verifying devices on sign in.

Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?
none of the stuff that i share on the internet is not that personal.

How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?
limit data access and sharing to only those who need it and only for the purposes that are relevant and necessary for your collaboration

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.
Ways to protect personal data include using privacy settings, reviewing tagged posts, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and being cautious with email attachments and links. There are numerous safeguards in place, including the use of technology to protect data for example by restricting access (using passwords or swipe cards to control access to data), or using encryption so the data can only be read with a code. IT systems must be kept up-to-date to protect against viruses and hacking.

Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community.

In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).
took an online course, read a book, watched a tutorial, or completed a project that required you to learn a new tool, technique, or concept.

In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.
 the need for uniquely human skills such as judgment, creativity and communication will increase as demand for easily automatable skills decreases.
