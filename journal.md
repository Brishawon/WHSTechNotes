You can create custom images using Sphero Edu's built in Matrix Animation editor.BOLT's magnetometer is designed to measure
Earth's magnetic field and help you find magnetic north, which means, you can use
BOLT as a compass.You can use those lux values to create dynamic programs that respond differently to different types of light and light intensities.

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
probably not that mutch.
What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
your grade will decrease.
Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?
because you have too do all of the work and if you dont you grade will go down.
Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
How Does AI Promote Innovation? AI transforms business operations and processes by automating routine tasks, extracting insights from data sets, and enhancing customer experiences. 
Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?
Machine Learning bias, also known as algorithm bias or Artificial Intelligence bias, refers to the tendency of algorithms to reflect human biases.
Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.
On the risk side, when one drives or gets on the road in general, there is a risk of getting caught in a traffic accident and getting badly injured. Potential risk refers to any risk associated with an action that is possible, in certain circumstances. A risk refers to a threat or damage that may occur in operations of any work.
